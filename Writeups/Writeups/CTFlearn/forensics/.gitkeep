# Binwalk Challenge – CTFLearn Writeup

## Introduction
In this writeup, I will explain how I solved the **“Binwalk” challenge** on CTFLearn and captured the flag.  
The challenge file required some **hidden data **, so I decided to use the tool **`binwalk`**.  

## File Analysis
At first glance, the file seemed normal, but I suspected it might contain **hidden data**.  
To investigate, I used **`binwalk`**, a tool for analyzing binary files.  
> `binwalk` helps find **hidden files, compressed data, or other embedded information** inside a file’s structure.  

```bash
